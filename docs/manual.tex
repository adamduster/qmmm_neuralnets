\begin{abstract}
This python package contains code for creating and training NN models to predict energies and gradients.
Models are created using the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.
Models can be saved in a servable format for use with TensorFlow Serving and interface with the Fort-BPSF program.

\section{Water Models}
This section covers the code and files used to create NN for the example.

\section{Correction Term}
The correction term in the water model is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
	E_\mathrm{Corr} = E_{\mr{MP2}} - \mu_{E_{\mr{MP2}}} - (E_{\mr{SE}} - \mu_{E_{\mr{SE}}})
\end{equation}
Where $E_{\mr{MP2}}$ is the MP2 electronic energy, $E_{\mr{SE}}$ is the semiempirical heat of formation, and $\mu_{E}$ is the average energy of the data used to calculate the correction term.
